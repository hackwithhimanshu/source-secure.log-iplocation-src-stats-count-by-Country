# 📊 Splunk Log Analysis Portfolio  
*A practical showcase of my hands-on Splunk skills using real log data*

This repository demonstrates my ability to work with **Splunk Enterprise**, upload and index log data, extract useful fields, apply **SPL (Search Processing Language)**, and create visualizations.  
I used two log files:

- `access.log` — Web access logs from a simulated e-commerce website  
- `secure.log` — Linux authentication and SSH security logs

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives
This repository is built to clearly demonstrate my **practical skills** as a junior SOC / Security Analyst:

### ✔ Parsing & Indexing Logs  
- Uploading local log files into Splunk  
- Assigning correct sourcetypes  
- Checking event timestamps, line breaking, and field extraction

### ✔ SPL Searching  
Using SPL for:
- Filtering events  
- Extracting fields (`rex`)  
- Aggregations (`stats`, `top`, `rare`)  
- Time-based analysis (`timechart`)  
- Geo-location enrichment (`iplocation`)  
- Creating table views

### ✔ Visualizations  
- Pie charts  
- Bar charts  
- Timecharts  
- Tabular reports
